# Bitplebs - Silent Payments

## What is Silent Payments?

Silent Payments (BIP352) is a Bitcoin protocol that enables receiving private payments from anyone on a single static address without requiring any interaction or extra on-chain overhead. Unlike traditional Bitcoin transactions that require communication or leave metadata, silent payments use static addresses that can't be linked to payments on-chain. Transactions appear indistinguishable from regular ones, protecting sender and receiver privacy, supporting CoinJoins, and avoiding accidental address reuse. The protocol leverages elliptic curve cryptography, requiring recipients to scan the blockchain for payments, and includes label support for easy payment management. Itâ€™s upgradeable, compatible with standard wallet backups, and designed to balance privacy, convenience, and security.
